# Telco Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks ANN
This project delivers an end-to-end churn prediction solution for a telecommunications company using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas. It demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from in-depth data preprocessing and intelligent feature engineering to designing and training a powerful artificial neural network. By uncovering hidden patterns in customer behavior, service preferences, and account history, the model accurately predicts which customers are at risk of leaving. Achieving impressive accuracy, this project highlights how deep learning can transform customer retention strategies through data-driven insights.
